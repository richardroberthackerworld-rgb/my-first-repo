# 7Marks 💯

Pick a subject & topic — or snap photos of your textbook / notes — and generate a full **question bank**: theory or practical, long answer, short answer, very short answer, MCQs, fill in the blanks, and true/false — with an optional answer key. The sister app of [7Solve](../doubtsnap/) (7Solve answers *your* questions; 7Marks *asks you* questions).

## Features
- 📷 **Photo material** — upload up to **5 photos** of textbook pages or class notes (camera, gallery, drag & drop, paste Ctrl+V). Questions are generated **only from that material**. Handwritten and printed pages both work.
- ⌨️ **Or just type a topic** — e.g. "Photosynthesis", "Quadratic Equations", "Chapter 4 — The Mughal Empire". You can combine topic + photos.
- 📝 **6 question types, mix freely** — MCQ (4 options), Very Short (1–2 lines), Short (3–5 lines), Long Answer / Essay, Fill in the Blanks, True/False — each with its own count (1–25).
- 📐 **Theory or Practical** — choose Theory (definitions, explanations, distinctions), Practical (numericals, sums, worked problems — automatically uses the strongest reasoning models so the answer key is correct), or Mixed.
- 🎚️ **Difficulty** — Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed (easy → hard within each section).
- 🧠 **Hard mode = strongest AI** — Hard difficulty automatically routes through the most powerful free reasoning models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (~50 req/day free, also reads photos), then OpenRouter's free heavyweights (NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra 555B, Tencent Hy3 295B, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b), falling back to the normal chain if they're busy.
- 🔑 **Answer key toggle** — generate with answers + explanations, but they stay hidden until you press "Show answer key". Practice first, check later.
- 🖨️ **Print / Save PDF** — prints only the question paper (clean, no site chrome). Answer key prints only if revealed.
- ➕ **More questions** — one click generates a fresh set on the same topic, telling the AI not to repeat questions it already asked.
- 🌐 **3 languages, fully translated UI + papers** — English, हिंदी, తెలుగు.
- 🎓 **Every level** — Class 1–10, Intermediate (MPC / BiPC / CEC / MEC / HEC), Degree & PG, CA / CMA (India) / US CMA / CS / ACCA / CFA, Jobs & competitive exams (UPSC, Groups, SSC, Banking, JEE/NEET…), Current Affairs & GK.
- 🤖 **Smart model routing** — auto-picks the best free AI model per subject and falls back if one is busy or rate-limited (same engine system as Doubt Snap).
- 🗂️ **My Paper Shelf** — last 20 generated papers saved on the device (localStorage).
- 📖 **Book theme** — same leather-and-paper look as Doubt Snap.

## Setup — add your free API keys

Open **`config.js`** and paste your free keys between the quotes. If you already set up Doubt Snap, **copy the same keys** — both apps share the same providers.

| # | Provider | Get a free key at | Key looks like | Best for |
|---|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | **Google Gemini** | https://aistudio.google.com/apikey | `AIza…` | **Photos** (textbook pages, handwriting, Telugu/Hindi). ~1500/day. |
| 2 | **Groq** | https://console.groq.com/keys | `gsk_…` | Fastest text papers (Llama 3.3 70B). |
| 3 | **Cerebras** | https://cloud.cerebras.ai → API Keys | `csk-…` | Very fast, high daily volume. |
| 4 | **OpenRouter** | https://openrouter.ai/keys | `sk-or-…` | Coding subjects (Qwen3 Coder) + photo fallback (Gemma 4). |
| 5 | **Mistral** (optional) | https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys | — | Text + Pixtral vision; doesn't log prompts. |
| 6 | **GitHub Models** | https://github.com/settings/tokens | `ghp_…` / `github_pat_…` | **DeepSeek-R1** (~150/day) — best free CA/CMA numericals solver — plus GPT-4o (~50/day) and Phi-4-Reasoning. Free with any GitHub account. |

**Minimum recommended:** add **Gemini** (for photos) + **Groq** (for fast text).

Visitors see a site tagline in the top-right. **Owner view:** open the site with `?owner=1` (e.g. `https://qbank.7by.in/?owner=1`) to see the real engine status badge and which model generated each paper. All keys stay in `config.js` on your own site — the app calls the providers directly from the browser.

## How the app chooses a model (automatic)
- **Hard difficulty, or CA · CMA · Professional level (automatic)** → Gemini 2.5 Pro → DeepSeek-R1 + Phi-4-Reasoning (GitHub Models) → Nemotron 3 Ultra 555B → Hy3 295B → gpt-oss-120b → then the normal chain below
- **Maths / Accounts (reasoning)** also tries GPT-4o via GitHub Models right after Gemini.
- **Photos attached** → Gemini (best vision) → OpenRouter Gemma 4 → Mistral Pixtral
- **Coding / programming subjects** → OpenRouter Qwen3 Coder → Gemini → Groq → Cerebras
- **Maths / Physics / Accounts (reasoning)** → Gemini → Cerebras → Groq → OpenRouter
- **Current affairs / GK** → Gemini → OpenRouter → Groq
- **General / language subjects** → Gemini → Groq → Cerebras → OpenRouter

If the first choice is missing a key or hits its limit, it automatically tries the next one.

## Run
Static files — open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder:

```
npx serve qbank
```

No build step, no dependencies.

## Deploy — launch on `qbank.7by.in` (cPanel)

The homepage tool card and footer already link to `https://qbank.7by.in`, so going live is just:

1. cPanel → **Domains → Create A New Domain** → `qbank.7by.in`. Uncheck "share document root"; let it create `/home/USER/qbank.7by.in` as the document root.
2. **File Manager** → open that folder → upload **`qbank-site.zip`** (from the repo root) → **Extract**. The files must sit directly in the document root.
3. **Rename `config.js.txt` → `config.js`** (right-click → Rename), then **Edit** it and paste your API keys. *(The zip ships it as `.txt` because cPanel's virus scanner false-positives on any zip containing `.js` files — "Foxhole.JS_Zip". It's not a real virus.)*
4. cPanel → **SSL/TLS Status → Run AutoSSL** so `https://qbank.7by.in` is secure.
5. Also re-upload the updated main-site `index.html` (or `vocalremover-app.zip`) so the homepage 7Marks card shows the new name.

Visit `https://qbank.7by.in` — the ⚙️ badge at the top-right should show your active engines. If it says "No AI key set", `config.js` on the server still has empty keys.

## ⚠️ Note on key privacy
Because this is a static site, any key you put in `config.js` is visible to anyone who can open the page's source. That's fine for personal use or a private/local deployment. If you ever put this on a **public** website, move the keys behind a tiny backend proxy so visitors can't read them.
